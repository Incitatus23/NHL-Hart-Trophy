# Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create a model to predict the likelihood of a top-5 Hart Trophy (MVP) finish for players. The data includes the top 50 point leaders 
from all post-lockout seasons, and does not factor in goalies. The code for an extremely basic flask app is included as well.
